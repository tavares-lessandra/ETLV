    <p> The section AC is for those who want to create sustainable ways of making houses. In this section you'd better like to work in architecture and construction.
            Moreover the groups work Is put forward, when we practice, do mock-up and handle tools or materials. It's a school subject where 
            we can communicate, 
            discuss and exchange between us about creation, innovation and imagine while integrating sustainable development.
            After our final exam we can have a “Brevet de Technicien Supérieur” which means “Higher Technician Certificate” or a 
            “Diplôme Universitaire Technologique” which means “Technological University degree”. However there is a preparatory school for the
             best or a superior school.
