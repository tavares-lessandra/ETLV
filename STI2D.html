    <p>We are in a section called STI2D which means Science and technology of industry and sustainabilty development. There we learn ingeneer 
            and how to deals with sustainability issues. Then in final year of high school we'll need to choice between AC, EE, SIN and ITEC. 
            We choice to present you AC which is architecture and construction. 
            This subject is mostly chosen by boys however there are girls and whatâ€™s interesting is that girls have a different ways to think. 
            The section STI2D look like the section S, which is Scientific, but with more manipulation.
