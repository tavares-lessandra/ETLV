        <p class="p2">Filled with history the French republic is a country
            with an area of 643 801(six hundred forty three 
           thousand eight hundred one) square kilometres. 
           There are eighteen regions and we're in one of them called 
           Nouvelle Aquitaine. Our high school is in Pau and 
           it's called Lyc√©e Saint Cricq. Our high school is a 
           technologic and general high school which means 
           that we have students who want to become for example
            engineer and students who want to become a doctor or a lawyer.</p>
